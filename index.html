    <h1 style="color: rgb(20, 20, 223);">WHY I JOINED CODEQUEEN</h1>
    <h2 style="color: crimson;">Breif background</h2>
    <p>My name is Suzan Apolot, an Environmentalist by proffesion. I have practiced my proffession for about five<br> 
        years and now I feel my professional life is in a rut. Feel like am stuck somewhere. <br>
        So I would like to try out something new, exciting and fun. Something like programming.<br>
        Glad I joined because am already loving it&#128525.
        <h2 style="color: crimson;"> Why I Choose To Join The Program</h2>
        <p>There are quite a number of reasons why I choose to join the program.<br>
            Here are some of them;</p>
        <ul>
            <li>To try out something new, in otherwards get out of my comfort zone and learn a new skill</li>
            <li>Since its a marketable skill, wanted to better my employment opportunities</li>
            <li>To accquire skills that will improve my running business</li>
            <li>Have always thought of building an app, so I saw the program as a starting point to my wish</li>
            <li>It was easy to sign up and study the course since it was all online</li>
        </ul>
    <p>Many have told me that coding is a good skill to have and many are learned it including those not in the <br>
    Tech industry. So although I completely have no clue about programming, I am ready to try it out.</p>
